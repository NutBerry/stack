# Current situation

There are some denial of service attacks that are possible by the
permissionless design of the side-chain and of the truebit-like verification game.
Some will be eliminated or reduced by implementing incentives and rules.
The problem of possible long-running challenges of the truebit-like game will be removed
completely in the future by switching the validation mechanics based on
[this](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-chain-gated-computing-by-patching-the-control-flow-of-arbitrary-smart-contracts/6387).
